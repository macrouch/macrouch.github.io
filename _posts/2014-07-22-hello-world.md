This is just a cool test post!

I have been working on a lot of different projects recently, and decided instead of just Tweeting pictures I should be writing about them. Hopefully this blog will help me both keep track of what I have done, and share my random projects with the world.

I have been reading a lot about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) recently, and thought it would be a great fit since most of my projects are hosted on [my github](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).
