A few months ago, I bought a Printrbot Simple 2014 3d printer. It has been a ton of fun to print mostly useless things out of plastic. There is a fantastic open source community in the 3d printing world, and I quickly found models that I could print to improve features of my printer. Here is a list of the upgrades I have printed for my Printrbot Simple 2014.

X and Y Axes GT2 Belt Upgrades
-----------------------
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194586" target="_blank">Y-Axis Upgrade</a> |
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:194686" target="_blank">X-Axis Upgrade</a> |
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:257841" target="_blank">X-Axis Upgrade, take 2</a>

The standard Printrbot Simple comes with a sandpaper pulley and fishing line system to move the X and Y axes. This was working for me, but I decided to do some upgrades that allowed the X and Y axes to be belt driven instead. This would improve precision and longevity of the printer.

XL Aluminum Print Bed
---------------------
This larger print bed gives me more room to print! I had to buy larger x-axis smooth rods to accommodate the larger sheet of aluminum.

Z-Axis Auto-Leveling Probe
--------------------------

<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:308565" target="_blank">Current mount</a>

This induction sensor measures the bed in three places before every print, and uses the values to adjust the z-axis on the fly throughout the print. This means I don't have to very carefully level the bed before every single print! It really makes life a lot easier, and gives much better results. I have gone through a couple of different mounts for the probe.

Legs

These legs use existing screw holes to mount to the back of the printer, and improve the stability of the printer, something I needed when I installed the larger print bed.
